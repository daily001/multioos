# Minimalist Markdown Editor for Chrome

This is the source for the **simplest** and **slickest** Markdown editor for Chrome (both the browser and the OS). [Download on the Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimalist-markdown-edito/pghodfjepegmciihfhdipmimghiakcjf)  
Just write Markdown and see what it looks like as you type. And convert it to HTML in one click.

# The Minimalist Markdown Editor project

The Minimalist Markdown Editor project is available both online as a web app, and offline as a Chrome app:

- [Web app](http://markdown.pioul.fr) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/pioul/Minimalist-Online-Markdown-Editor))
- [Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimalist-markdown-edito/pghodfjepegmciihfhdipmimghiakcjf) (the source code is in this repo)

# Contributing

The two project branches share a decent amount of code. This common source code sits in `/editor` in each of these branches.  
It's synced in and out of them using [subtrees](https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree/blob/master/git-subtree.txt) and a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/pioul/MME-shared).

Unless you really want to dig in and make a lot of changes both in `/editor` and the rest of the app, you shouldn't need to care about this. Fork one of the two projects and send a pull request whenever you feel like it.
